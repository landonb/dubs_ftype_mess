" What'sAKeyword See The F1 Command / Ctrl-R Ctrl-W
" ------------------------------------------------------

" [lb] just took the default for Python files.
" The default for rst is: iskeyword=38,42,43,45,47-58,60-62,64-90,97-122,_
" but then, e.g., colons are included in word-under-cursor selections,
" which makes searching some_word: not find some_word.
"
" Either BufEnter/BufRead and Filetype should work... the latter
" should run just once which should be all we need.
"  autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal iskeyword=@,48-57,_,192-255
autocmd Filetype rst setlocal iskeyword=@,48-57,_,192-255

" Spell Checking! [sic]
" ------------------------------------------------------

" [lb] tested spell checking for obviously-texty files,
" like txt and log, but there's too much of a mix
" of English and non-dictionary tokens. Only reST seems
" to work, especially since spell check ignores ``literals``.

autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spell

" Note that I tried a variation on the command,
"
"   autocmd Filetype rst setlocal spell
"
" but for some reason when I switched buffers to a code file, spell checking
" was still enabled. You could get over that with the above command,
"
"   autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spell

" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Spell Checking cAPITALIZATION
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

" 2014.11.20: on 'blah... blah', the latter blah is underlined blue, indicating
" it's not capitalized. How would you fix the spellcapcheck to be okay with
" that?
"
" There are two ways to disable caps checking: changing the spellcapcheck
" variable,
"
"   set spellcapcheck=
"
" or disabling the highlight:
"
"   highlight clear SpellCap
"
" You can copy the default spellcapcheck using TabMessage:
"
"   :TabMessage set spellcapcheck spellcapcheck=[.?!]\_[\])'"^I ]\+
"
" And you can easily peruse the list of over 1,000 highlights similary:
"
"   :TabMessage hi
"
" There are five highlights with the word 'spell' in their name:
"
"   SpellBad xxx term=reverse ctermbg=12 gui=undercurl guisp=Red SpellCap xxx
"   term=reverse ctermbg=9 gui=undercurl guisp=Blue SpellRare xxx term=reverse
"   ctermbg=13 gui=undercurl guisp=Magenta SpellLocal xxx term=underline
"   ctermbg=11 gui=undercurl guisp=DarkCyan hl-SpellCap xxx cleared

autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spellcapcheck=

" FIXME: MAGIC_VALUE: Hrm, we cannot use a modeline to set highlight.
"        See: DG_CycleThruStyleGuides_. We parse the head and tail of
"        each file looking for a modeline and call 'set', so we could
"        do the same: look for a highlight-type modeline. But for now,
"        just bake this in. I can only think of one person with a file
"        of this name, so for most people, this'll be a no-op.
autocmd BufEnter,BufRead peckerwords.rst highlight clear rstEmphasis

" Other filetypes to spell check.
" -------------------------------

" E.g., todo.txt.
autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.txt setlocal spell
autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.txt setlocal spellcapcheck=

" Override .rst syntax ``.. code-block:: <language>`` mapping.
" ------------------------------------------------------------
" SYNC_ME: Similar *.rst changes in dubs_preloads.vim and rst_dubsacks.vim.

" In the preload file we added a few of the built-in syntaxes for
" Sphinx's `.. code-block:: <language>` mapping. Here we add syntaxes
" we've added to ~/.vim/syntax that are not standard.

" Add a few of our own syntaxes, er, syntaxii.
" Included Alternative File Extension Syntax File Type Mappings.

" The following code is adapted from
"   /usr/share/vim/vim74/syntax/rst.vim
" I added ~/.vim/, the nested list, a lookup in ~, and some spaces.
" Note that you cannot run the for-in loop without unletting first, else,
"   E706: Variable type mismatch for: code.
" That is, unless you use a unique name rather than `code`.
" I'm not sure where it's set (the syntax/rst.vim system file?),
" and it's not a global, or at least `:echo g:code` shows naught.
" So either use a unique name or just unlet, to be safe, or both.
" See: :help E706.
