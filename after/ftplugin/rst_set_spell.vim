" Optional: Set g: variable to disable plugin from ever loading. But leave
"           b: variable alone, to prevent plugin from re-running on :edit.

" Spell Checking! [sic]

autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spell

" Note that I tried a variation on the command,
"
"   autocmd Filetype rst setlocal spell
"
" but for some reason when I switched buffers to a code file, spell checking
" was still enabled. You could get over that with the above command,
"
"   autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spell

" Spell Checking cAPITALIZATION
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

" 2014-11-20: Writing the text, 'blah... blah', the latter 'blah' is
"             undercurled, to indicate that it is not capitalized.
"
" 2021-08-16: Updated investigation follows:
"
" - The highlight is controlled by the SpellCap highlight, e.g.,
"
"     SpellCap xxx term=reverse cterm=undercurl ctermbg=12 gui=undercurl guibg=#2E3440 guisp=#EBCB8B
"
"   (Open a reST document and run `:TabMessage hi` to see the (long) list of highlights.)
"
"   A naive approach might be to remove the highlight, e.g.,
"
"     highlight clear SpellCap
"
" - A more appropriate solution is to tweak or clear the spellcapcheck rule, e.g.,
"
"     set spellcapcheck=
"
" - You can use TabMessage to grab a copy of the current spellcapcheck value, e.g.,
"

autocmd BufEnter,BufRead *.rst setlocal spellcapcheck=
